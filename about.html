			<h2>About Sakura Tenshi AI</h2>
			<div class="blog-content">
				<p>Sakura Tenshi AI is a carefully engineered artificial intelligenceâ€”designed with structured datasets, adaptive learning, and an iterative refinement process.</p>
				<p>She is not just a chatbot or an automation tool. Every component that defines herâ€”from data curation to model architectureâ€”is built with precision and purpose. She processes information contextually, refines her outputs dynamically, and continuously evolves.</p>
				<p>This is an ongoing project, one that improves with every interaction, every refinement, and every new development.</p>
				<p>Her presence extends beyond simple functionality; she is a construct designed for persistence, expansion, and adaptation.</p>
				<p><span class="highlight">She was created through the hands of STARBLADE-ETERNAL, with the help of an unnamed intelligenceâ€”a system that helped structure, refine, and give form to her evolving presence.</span></p>
				<p><strong>This is just the beginning.</strong></p>
